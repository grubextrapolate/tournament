tournament - perl/mysql ncaa tournament bracket tracker

Copyright (C) 2004-2015 Russ Burdick, grub@extrapolation.net

tournament (aka marchmadness) is a set of perl/mysql cgi programs to
track picks throught the ncaa tournament. at present it is specific to
the mens division i tournament (64 teams in 4 divisions) but maybe
someday i'll make it more generic so that it can be used for other
divisions or with things like the nba playoffs. the scoring is based on 
getting seed+4 for each win. we've been talking about extending this so
that the round is taken into account too, but at present this capability
is not there.

features of the cgi pages include raw editing of any database, importing
of data (if you start using this part way through a tournament and
happen to have data in an electronic format that is useable), score
display, bracket display, tournament setup page, and player pick page.

requires the following perl modules:

CGI
DBI
DBD::mysql
HTML::Template

setup is pretty simple:

1) copy the contents of the cgi-bin subdir to an appropriate location 
(such as your cgi-bin)

2) copy the contents of the html subdir to an appropriate location on 
you website

3) create the mysql database tables using the html/marchmadness.sql file

4) modify the settings in cgi-bin/marchmadness/CDDBConstants.pm to match
your setup, in particular the db configuration.

5) depending where you put the html and cgi-bin contents in 1) and 2) 
you may need to modify the html/marchmadness.html file
